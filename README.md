# SMS Classification Project

## Overview

This project aims to classify SMS messages into predefined categories using machine learning techniques. SMS classification is a common task in natural language processing (NLP) and has various applications such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, and topic categorization.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify incoming SMS messages into relevant categories. This involves training a machine learning model on a labeled dataset of SMS messages and then evaluating its performance on unseen data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of labeled SMS messages, where each message is associated with a category label. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model, respectively. It includes a diverse range of messages covering different topics and categories.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The raw SMS messages are preprocessed to remove noise, such as special characters, stopwords, and punctuation. Additionally, the text may be tokenized and normalized for further processing.

2. **Feature Extraction**: Features are extracted from the preprocessed text to represent each message numerically. Common techniques for feature extraction include Bag-of-Words (BoW), Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), and word embeddings.

3. **Model Selection**: Various machine learning algorithms are explored for classification, including but not limited to Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

4. **Model Training**: The selected model is trained on the training dataset using the extracted features. Hyperparameters tuning and cross-validation may be employed to optimize model performance.

5. **Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on the testing dataset using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This step helps assess the model's performance and generalization ability.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Download the dataset and place it in the designated directory.
3. Run the preprocessing script to clean and preprocess the data.
4. Extract features from the preprocessed text using the provided feature extraction methods.
5. Train the selected model using the extracted features.
6. Evaluate the trained model on the testing dataset to assess its performance.
